"Betting Soroban" is a decentralized betting platform built on the Stellar blockchain. Users can place bets on various events, including sports matches, elections, or even cryptocurrency prices, using the platform's native token. The project ensures transparency and security through blockchain technology, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

Users create accounts and deposit funds securely into their digital wallets. Smart contracts handle the betting process, ensuring fair outcomes and automatic payouts. The platform offers real-time updates on events and odds, allowing users to make informed decisions.

To maintain integrity, the project implements robust verification processes to prevent fraud and manipulation. Users can also stake their tokens to participate in the platform's governance and decision-making.

Betting Soroban aims to revolutionize the betting industry by providing a transparent, secure, and accessible platform for users worldwide.

# Vision

#Software development plan
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Collaborate with stakeholders to define the smart contract functionalities, including betting options, payout mechanisms, and user account management. Identify front-end requirements such as user interface design and user authentication.

2. **Smart Contract Development**: Develop smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain to handle betting transactions, including functions for placing bets, calculating odds, and processing payouts. Define variables to store betting data, user balances, and contract state.

3. **Testing and Optimization**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the smart contracts function as intended, including unit testing and simulation of betting scenarios. Optimize contract code for efficiency and gas cost reduction.

4. **Front-end Development**: Design and develop a user-friendly front-end interface for the web and/or mobile platforms. Implement features for account creation, depositing funds, placing bets, and viewing betting history.

5. **Integration and Testing**: Integrate the front-end with the smart contracts to enable seamless interaction with the blockchain. Test the integration to ensure data accuracy, security, and user experience consistency.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain and publish the front-end application for users to access. Monitor the platform for any issues post-deployment and implement updates as needed to enhance functionality and security.

# Journey of this project
As I delved into the world of blockchain technology, I envisioned a platform that would revolutionize bettingâ€”an industry fraught with opacity and distrust. With unwavering determination, I embarked on the journey to create "Betting Soroban" on the Stellar blockchain.

Hours turned into days as I meticulously crafted smart contracts, ensuring each line of code upheld transparency and fairness. From defining betting options to perfecting payout mechanisms, I left no stone unturned.

Simultaneously, I poured my energy into developing an intuitive front-end interface, striving to make the platform accessible to all. With each design iteration, I was driven by the belief that betting could be a democratic process, free from manipulation.

Finally, after overcoming countless obstacles, I launched Betting Soroban to the world. Users embraced the platform, finding refuge in its transparency and trustworthiness. Through Betting Soroban, I not only reshaped the betting industry but also left a legacy of integrity and empowerment.

# Betting Contract

This contract facilitates betting functionalities within a blockchain environment. Users can initialize a bet, register participants, buy tickets, and play the bet. Below is a breakdown of the contract functionalities:

## Initialization
- **init_bet**: Initializes the bet with parameters such as the admin address, token address, maximum winners count, and ticket price.

## Participant Management
- **register**: Registers a participant in the bet.
- **buy_ticket**: Allows participants to buy tickets for the bet.

## Bet Execution
- **play_bet**: Executes the bet by selecting winners based on a random seed and distributing payouts accordingly.

## Error Handling
The contract defines several error conditions to handle various scenarios such as insufficient funds, already initialized bet, already played bet, and more.

## Storage Keys
- **Admin**: Stores the address of the admin.
- **Candidates**: Stores the list of participant addresses.
- **MaxWinnerCount**: Stores the maximum count of winners allowed.
- **TicketPrice**: Stores the price of a ticket.
- **Token**: Stores the address of the token.
- **AlreadyInitialized**: Indicates whether the bet has already been initialized.
- **AlreadyPlayed**: Indicates whether the bet has already been played.

## Error Types
The contract defines custom error types to provide clear feedback in case of failures during execution.
